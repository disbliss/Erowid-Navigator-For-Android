These files were generated with (JAXB) Reference Implementation, v2.2.4-2
This schema was generated with :http://www.erowid.org/general/big_chart_xml.xsd (found inside http://www.erowid.org/general/big_chart_xml.xsd )

They were then modified to be used with XStream. JAXB in android is really challenging due to it not being included in android java at this point.
XStream, on the other hand, cannot convert xsd files to classes, so JAXB was used.

Some original tags have been left from JAXB, and have been commented out.
Most of the new tags added for XStream were to map xml elements named with '-' characters, as these are not supported for file names in java.
